# You should be brought to a new screen, where your API key, a long string of random letters and numbers, will show up. This is all you need -- copy this and paste it into the above quotations! MAKE SURE you follow the rest of the instructions in this file before making any other commits to git.

# TODO 364: Add this file name:
# giphy_api_key.py
# to the included .gitignore file.
# Then save, add, and commit the .gitignore file to YOUR git repository.
